# Description

# üå¶Ô∏è WeatherApp ‚Äì Java Console Application using OpenWeatherMap API

WeatherApp is a simple and educational Java console application that fetches real-time weather data for any city using the OpenWeatherMap REST API. It demonstrates how Java can interact with online APIs, handle JSON responses, and display the results in a clean, structured format.

# Features

‚úÖ Accepts any city name as user input
‚úÖ Makes an HTTP GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API
‚úÖ Parses the JSON response using the org.json library
‚úÖ Displays key weather data:
     -Temperature (in ¬∞C)
     -Humidity (%)
     -Weather description (e.g., "clear sky")
     -Wind speed (m/s)
‚úÖ Clean and readable console output
‚úÖ Error handling for invalid city names or connection issues

# Technologies Used
  -Java (JDK 8+)
  -HttpURLConnection (built-in Java class for HTTP requests)
  -org.json (external library for JSON parsing)
  -OpenWeatherMap REST API

# How It Works
-The user is prompted to enter the name of a city.
-The app forms a URL using that city name and the OpenWeatherMap API key.
-It sends a GET request to the API server.
-The response is received in JSON format.
-The program parses the JSON and extracts weather details.
-The data is printed to the console in a user-friendly format.

# Learning Outcomes
-By working on this project, you will:
-Understand how to consume REST APIs in Java
-learn how to send HTTP requests and handle responses
-Gain experience with JSON parsing
-Practice error handling and user interaction in Java

# Conclusion
This WeatherApp project is a great way to learn how Java can be used with real-time data from the internet. It teaches how to connect to a public API, fetch information, and display it in a neat format. The project is simple, beginner-friendly, and shows the basics of working with HTTP requests and JSON in Java.
You can build on this app by adding more features like checking multiple cities, saving results to a file, or even creating a graphical interface. It‚Äôs a small project, but it teaches important concepts that are useful in many real-world applications.
